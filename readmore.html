          <h1> PollutionReduction :</h1>
          <p>Paper production is a significant source of air and water pollution, with emissions of greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and wastewater containing harmful chemicals. By recycling paper, these pollution emissions can be reduced significantly. (Source: United Nations Environment Programme)

        <p> Recycling paper is a crucial strategy for mitigating these impacts and conserving natural resources.
            The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that if the global paper industry were to achieve 70% recycling rates by 2050, it could lead to a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to business-as-usual scenarios.</p>
